# Superarhow's jpeg decoder

It's a jpeg baseline decoder written in pure C.

I wrote it for about 16 years ago and pasted it to forum but now I think github is the proper place to contain the code.

Under windows, you direct get a HBITMAP using jpegwin.h

Please see main.c for details.

It may contain bugs, and just for study use only. (Well, I just don't have time to maintenance it :-P)
